# tictactoe
A tictactoe web app I create as a training using only plain HTML, CSS and JS.

There are several dev.md files put in various places, helping me to understand what I am doing and why I am doing that (I am still learning a lot about webdev and this is my way of taking notes (: ).
Check out the 'clean' branch for a cleaned version (no promise I already created it).
